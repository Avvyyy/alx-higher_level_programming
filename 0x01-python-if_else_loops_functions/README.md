. This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.

You can find the source code here
The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program
You don’t have to understand what import, random. randint do. Please do not touch this code
The output of the program should be:
The number, followed by
if the number is greater than 0: is positive
if the number is 0: is zero
if the number is less than 0: is negative
followed by a new line

2. This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.

You can find the source code here
The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program
You don’t have to understand what import, random.randint do. Please do not touch this code. This line should not change: number = random.randint(-10000, 10000)
The output of the program should be:
The string Last digit of, followed by
the number, followed by
the string is, followed by the last digit of number, followed by
if the last digit is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
if the last digit is 0: the string and is 0
if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0
followed by a new line

The last number should be followed by a new line
You can only use no more than 2 print functions with string format
You can only use one loop in your code
You are not allowed to store numbers or strings in a variable
You are not allowed to import any module

7. Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
The two digits must be different
01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1
Print only the smallest combination of two digits
Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
The last number should be followed by a new line

Returns the value of a + b
You are not allowed to import any module
You don’t need to understand __import__

12. Write a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.

Prototype: def pow(a, b):
Returns the value of a ^ b
You are not allowed to import any module
You don’t need to understand __import__

13. Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.

For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for multiples of five print Buzz.
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
Prototype: def fizzbuzz():
Each element should be followed by a space
You are not allowed to import any module
You don’t need to understand __import__
